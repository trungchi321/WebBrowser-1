What webBrowser V 6.0 does:

This version of webBrowser fixes a few minor bugs.  In terms of grading, all the requirements from ALL previous versions of the APP WERE MET.
SO NO CHANGES HAD TO BE MADE IN TERMS OF GRADING.  The few minor bugs that were fixed were:

	*The cancel button would continue to display if the back and forward buttons were pressed when there was no webpage to go forward or back to.
	*When adjusting the settings and returning to the about app section, the return button in about app did not do anything.

*****Please note that the notification is time specific and matches the current time of the device.  The device the app was programmed on was
     a standard android phone and like most android phones, by default it uses 12 hour time format so the time on the avd MUST BE CHANGED TO
     THE CURRENT TIME for the app to work properly.*****
